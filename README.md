# Hey there! This is my repository for my projects while at BloomTech.

You'll find two notebooks, one with a ResNet50 model trained to predict whether or not an image has a frog inside of it, and the other with multiple kinds of classification models trained to predict whether a water pump in Tanzania requires repairs or not.

Thanks for taking a look! Message me with any question you may have!
